# Morse Code Converter

## Description
This project converts a given text into **Morse code**. It maps the characters of the input string (letters, numbers, punctuation marks, and spaces) to their respective Morse code equivalents. The program provides a simple way to encode messages in Morse code using a Python script.

## Features
- **Text to Morse Conversion**: Converts alphanumeric characters and common punctuation into Morse code.
- **Space Encoding**: Spaces are represented by a `/`.
- **Interactive**: The user is prompted to enter a text that is then converted to Morse code.

## Requirements
Ensure you have **Python** installed to run this script. The script doesn't require any external libraries.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   gh repo clone ulquiorraexe/morse-code-converter
2. Navigate to the directory:
   ```bash
   cd morse-code-converter
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python morse_code_converter.py

## Usage
The user is prompted to enter a text, and the script will output the corresponding Morse code.

## Notes
- This program maps letters (A-Z), numbers (0-9), and some punctuation marks to their corresponding Morse code.
- Spaces between words are represented by a `/` in Morse code.
- The program handles any case input (uppercase or lowercase).
- The script can be extended to support more punctuation or other custom features.
